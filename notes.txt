Let's start with some simple things.
TCP 3 way handshake.
simple_http.pcap
packets 1-3 hand shake
packet 4 HTTP GET
packet 5 ACK
Packet 6 response
Packets 7-10 normal shutdown.
Packets 50-57 keep alive

TCP 3 way handshake with IPv6
SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK handshake.  4 way shutdown.

IPv6 neighbor discovery protocol RFC 4861, 5942, 6980, 7048
ip6-ndp-05.cap
fe80 is link local address (look at how the LS 32 bits come from MAC)
ff02::16 is link local
ff02::2 is router solicitation, ff02::1 is router advertisement

ARP working properly arp_success.pcap
ARP failing  arp_failure.pcap




DNS  dns.pcap
packet 79 non-existant-domain-name.com packet 80 response 26 msec later
Where are all those queries to daisy.ubuntu.com coming from? whoopsie see Ubuntu launchpad bug 991481
dns2.pcap
search for string "google".  Find query 0x9b11  look at packet 14. 

Lossy network
dropped_TCP_packets.pcap.pcpng
40% packet loss
I don't know the client sent a RESET packet in packet 204.


Queen_Anne_Starbucks.pcapng. 69088 packets in 266 seconds = 259 packets/sec.

How many machines are present?
Statistics => endpoint list => Ethernet
40 unique MAC addresses
388 unique IP addresses.  Why the desparity?

TCP Resets
display filter tcp.flags.reset==1
SSL will send a TCP RESET instead of a FIN packet, I don't know why.
tcp.flags.reset==1 and tcp.srcport == 80
Pick packet 59711.
Pick packet 59658.


15th_ave_e_starbucks.pcapng
packet 9 Trying to reach port 443 and failing
Try filter tcp.flags.syn==1
Look at packet 1108 which is a TCP connection over IPv6.  Right click and follow TCP stream.  Why is packet 1544 IPv4 but still in this stream?
